Configuration
-------------
This plugin is based on SQLAlchemy and supports all databases that SQLAlchemy does.

These configuration options can be used:

.. configuration_options_start

#. | ``sql_connection``: SQLAlchemy connection string
   | Format: ``{driver}://[user]:[password]@{DBSERVER}/{DATABASE}``
   | SQLite example:
   | ``sqlite:///somedb.db``
   | MSSQL example with domain user authentication:
   | ``mssql+pymssql://ACME\\dbuser:verysecret@DBSRV1/INFRA``
#. | ``hosts_query``: Select statement which returns hosts inventory elements.
   | The select must return at minimum the ``name`` field!
   | Field names must match the expected Nornir inventory elements!
   | The ``data`` elements are expected in ``data.[element]`` format. Quotation is needed!
   | If ``groups`` are returned, the following ``groups_query`` also has to be specified!
#. | ``groups_query``: Select statement which returns groups inventory elements.
   | Same requirements apply as for the ``hosts_query``.
#. | ``groups_file``: path to a YAML file containing group definitions. Format is that same as used by
     ``SimpleInventory``
   | This parameter is ignored when ``groups_query`` or ``groups`` are specified!
   | Using this parameter requires group assignments outside of this plugin!
     Check `docs <https://viktorkertesz.github.io/nornir_sql/configuration/using-groups.html>`__!
#. | ``groups``: group definition as dict. Same restrictions and features apply as by using ``groups_file``!
   | Ignored when ``groups_query`` is specified!
   | Using this parameter requires group assignments outside of this plugin!
     Check `docs <https://viktorkertesz.github.io/nornir_sql/configuration/using-groups.html>`__!
#. | ``defaults``: This is a dictionary which contains inventory elements. These will be applied to hosts.
