Configuration
-------------
.. configuration

This plugin is based on SQLAlchemy and supports all databases that SQLAlchemy does.

These configuration options can be used:

#. | ``sql_connection``: SQLAlchemy connection string
   | Format: ``{driver}://[user]:[password]@{DBSERVER}/{DATABASE}``
   | SQLite example:
   | ``sqlite:///somedb.db``
   | MSSQL example with domain user authentication:
   | ``mssql+pymssql://ACME\\dbuser:verysecret@DBSRV1/INFRA``
#. | ``hosts_query``: Select statement which returns hosts inventory elements.
   | The select must return at minimum the ``name`` field!
   | Field names must match the expected Nornir inventory elements!
   | The ``data`` elements are expected in ``data.[element]`` format. Quotation is needed!
   | If ``groups`` are returned, the following ``groups_query`` also has to be specified!
#. | ``groups_query``: Select statement which returns groups inventory elements.
   | Same requirements apply as for the ``hosts_query``.
#. | ``defaults``: This is a dictionary which contains inventory elements. These will be applied to hosts.
